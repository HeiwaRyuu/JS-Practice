// This now is a training with conditionals in JavaScript

var a = 10;
var b = 20;

if( a < b ){
    var result = a + b;
    document.write("The result of a + b is : ",result);
}

// The command above is a conditional statement, that means it will only be read by the program if the codition is true
// As the condition is true, this code will be interpreted and will be printed on screen the sentence -> "The result of a + b is : 30"
